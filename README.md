Why Did I Make This Modpack?

I wanted to dive into the new Create 6.0 update and really explore everything it has to offer, but I also wanted a more complete experience - something that felt balanced, fun, and immersive. At the same time, I’ve always wanted to try my hand at making a modpack, so this was the perfect opportunity to put something together that I’d actually enjoy playing. Hopefully, you will too!
